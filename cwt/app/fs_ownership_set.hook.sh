# Implements hook -a 'fs_ownership_set' -s 'app instance' -v 'PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE'.
#
# (Re)sets the corresponding ownership to any list of paths optionally
# defined in the following globals (env vars) :
# - PROTECTED_FILES : e.g. path to sensitive settings file(s).
# - EXECUTABLE_FILES : e.g. custom app-related scripts.
# - WRITEABLE_DIRS : e.g. path to folders (files, tmp, private) that must be
#     writeable by the application.
# - WRITEABLE_FILES : additional files (outside of WRITEABLE_DIRS) that must be
#     writeable by the application.
#
# This file is dynamically included when the "hook" is triggered.
# @see u_instance_set_ownership() in cwt/instance/instance.inc.sh
#
# To verify which files can be used (and will be sourced) when this hook is
# triggered :
# $ make hook-debug s:app instance a:fs_ownership_set v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE
