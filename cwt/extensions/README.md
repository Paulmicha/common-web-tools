# CWT extensions

Every folder in this path is an extension, but not their subfolders.

In order to disable extensions without having to delete or move their folder,
add one per line in the dotfile `.cwt_extensions_ignore` (to be placed in this
directory, i.e. `cwt/extensions/.cwt_extensions_ignore`).
