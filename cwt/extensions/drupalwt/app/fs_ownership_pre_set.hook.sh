#
# (Re)sets filesystem ownership in application source files. This hook is
# triggered before the 'normal' hook so that specific lists of paths (which may
# be contained in app sources) get their owner/group applied correctly, without
# being caught by recursion - i.e. when subfolder needs different ownership.

# @see cwt/app/fs_ownership_set.hook.sh

# This file is dynamically included when the "hook" is triggered.
# @see u_instance_set_ownership() in cwt/instance/instance.inc.sh

# To verify which files can be used (and will be sourced) when this hook is
# triggered :
# $ make hook-debug s:app instance a:fs_ownership_pre_set v:PROVISION_USING HOST_TYPE INSTANCE_TYPE

# Handle projects using different Git repos for dev-stack and app.
