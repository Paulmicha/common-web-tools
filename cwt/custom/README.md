# Customization

All scripts placed in this directory are meant to override and/or complement existing CWT generic scripts.

Some scripts explicitly allow complements and/or overrides. Matching is done by testing if a file with the same name exists in this directory's corresponding subdir. See `cwt/utilities/autoload.sh` for details.

Example : `cwt/env/registry.sh`
