# Public web dir (the application).
# There are 2 implementation approaches for using common web tools in a project :
#   1 • Use a single, "monolothic" repo for everything
#   2 • [default] Keep application code in a separate Git repo
# → When using option 1, you may want to comment out the following lines.
# Note: these are common suggestions to adapt to project needs (option 2).
# The app docroot may also be located outside the project root dir.
