# Common Web Tools (CWT) documentation - Getting started

There are 2 ways to use CWT in existing or new projects :

1. Use a single, "monolothic" repo for everything
1. Keep application code in a separate Git repo (default, see `.gitignore`)

## Option 1 first steps

- Download and/or copy&paste CWT files into project root dir (existing or new Git repo)
- Undo default ignored subfolders in `.gitignore` file if/as needed

## Option 2 first steps

- Download CWT in desired location (aka the project root dir)
- Clone the application into a subfolder named e.g. `web`, `public`, etc.
- Gitignore that subfolder by updating the `.gitignore` file accordingly
- [optional] Make any alterations necessary
- [optional] Maintain as a separate repo

## Next steps

When CWT files are in place alongside the rest of the project :

- Initialize "stack" (environment settings)
- Provision local and/or remote host
- Install new application instance(s) (local and/or remote)
- [optional] Implement automated tests
- [optional] Implement deployment to desired remote instance(s)
