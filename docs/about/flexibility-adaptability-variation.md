# Flexibility (adaptability through variation)

See [conventions](conventions.html) for syntax - this documentation exemplifies mecanisms and use cases.

## Inclusivity

This is the simplest way to add possibilities or "entry points" (expanding trees) :

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Exclusivity

This requires a logic to get only 1 output.

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Relativity / isolation

TODO explore modularity by mutating reference points (at "runtime"), such as the `CWT_CUSTOM` global ?

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Recursion

Adds fractal complexity and potentially unexpected results / best used sparingly.

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```
