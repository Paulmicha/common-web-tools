# Flexibility (adaptability through variation)

See [conventions](conventions.html) for syntax - this documentation exemplifies mecanisms and use cases.

## Inclusivity

This is the simplest way to add possibilities or "entry points" (expanding trees) :

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Exclusivity

This requires a logic to get only 1 output.

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Relativity / isolation / modularity

TODO could just be a switch to make globals not use `export` in some scope / function.

TODO evaluate temporarily mutating reference points at runtime (i.e. `CWT_CUSTOM`) ?

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```

## Recursion

Adds fractal complexity and potentially unexpected results / best used sparingly.

```sh
# TODO provide minimal example.
```
